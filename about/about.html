        <p class="about_me">I’m Pabitra Pando, a passionate Front-End Developer from Christian Gaon, Assam, with a deep enthusiasm for transforming ideas into seamless digital experiences. My journey in the world of technology began with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications from HITS, where I built a strong foundation in software development, problem-solving, and innovative thinking. To further refine my expertise, I pursued Full-Stack Development training under Angela on Udemy, expanding my skill set to encompass modern web technologies and best practices.
With a keen eye for design and functionality, I specialize in crafting sleek, interactive, and user-friendly interfaces that enhance engagement and provide a smooth, immersive experience. I believe that technology should not only be efficient but also visually captivating, which drives my approach to front-end development—combining aesthetics with performance to create products that resonate with users.
Beyond coding, I am continuously exploring the latest trends in web development, staying updated with emerging frameworks, UI/UX principles, and innovative design methodologies. Whether it’s building dynamic websites, optimizing responsiveness, or improving accessibility, my goal is to create meaningful digital solutions that leave a lasting impression.
As I continue to evolve in my career, I strive to push boundaries and embrace new challenges that refine my abilities. Technology is ever-changing, and with my dedication to learning and adaptability, I am always ready to take on projects that inspire creativity and problem-solving
